This is a mobile AR web app which will download OpenStreetMap points of interest from a GeoJSON based API.
This app uses this API to display points of interest in the device camera so that the user can look around and see nearby points of interest.
For this, it uses AFRAME to render the 3d objects in the screen and place them at each point of interest location and according to the its type.

To run this app on a mobile device, visit the link above where you will be prompted to give access to location and camera and you will also have the option to download the app to your home screen.

To run this project on a desktop, simply download the project and open index.html and dont forget to allow for location so that the app presents points of interest near you and camera so that it can display them. this app works regardless if its a indoor camera, it will simply display the 3d models on the screen.
